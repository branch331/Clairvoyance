I want an application that has to-do list functionality, that I can also use to track and visualise how much time I spend on specific tasks. 

I find myself using sticky notes as my 'To-Do' list. I also use sticky notes to track how much 'time' i spend on each task, and add everything in the end to know how much time i've spent so far.

I don't want to spend the end of each week doing math to find how much time i've spent on certain tasks.

I also don't want to use sticky notes as my to-do list because once it's deleted from the note, it's gone. 

I want a to-do list that has calendar-esque functionality so I can plan out my day and week as well. But I don't want to bog down my outlook calendar. 

In the end, I want a lightweight/simplistic version of:
-Calendar functionality of Outlook
-To-do features similar to Trello
-Ability to add timeframes/easy UI, and time tracking as Azure DevOps
-Speed/simplicity of Sticky Notes

[Must-do]
[DONE] Display days on UI - have days/tasks fill entire datagrid
[DONE] Add "day" input field on UI >> Submit task to day
[DONE] Display tasks in days
[DONE] Checkbox should trigger DaysToDisplay to display work week or full week
Store days/task data somewhere
Category - generate and add items to list; populate drop-down
[DONE-ish] Please fix updateTaskListStrings; add logic to decide which task string list to update
[DONE] Add unit tests for updateTaskListStrings
Statistics - could even put a display on the bottom right that populates based on the 'category' list
Study ICommand/RelayCommand. Implement command for 'Submit' button. Add logic for submit category command
Category is empty string when added to calendar

[Optional]
Add 'Enter' command to text boxes?
TaskItemModel: Make sure input string is valid time
Make DateTime conversion in TaskItemModel PM?
ICommand instead of code behind? Not sure if this is more 'best practice'
Remove Description field overall, since it takes up space and might not be helpful
After 'Submit', erase all fields and place focus on the first entry
Edit existing tasks
Tasks should display as time blocks
